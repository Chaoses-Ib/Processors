## Benchmarks
N/A，比解码应该性能差异小得多。

## JIT
- [AsmJit: Low-latency machine code generation](https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit)

  > Complete x86/x64 JIT and AOT Assembler for C++

  [谈谈AsmJit - \_懒人 - 博客园](https://www.cnblogs.com/lanrenxinxin/p/5021641.html)

- [Xbyak: a JIT assembler for x86(IA-32)/x64(AMD64, x86-64) MMX/SSE/SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3/SSE4/FPU/AVX/AVX2/AVX-512 by C++ header](https://github.com/herumi/xbyak)
- [DynASM](https://luajit.org/dynasm.html)
  - Rust: [dynasm-rs: A dynasm-like tool for rust.](https://github.com/CensoredUsername/dynasm-rs)

## Rust
- [→iced](#iced)
- [playX18/asmkit: Assembler toolkit: encoding and decoding of various architectures](https://github.com/playX18/asmkit) (discontinued)
  - JIT

  [asmkit: assembler and disassembler for X64, RISCV64, ARM64(WIP) and potentially more architectures : r/rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1gpnw1e/asmkit_assembler_and_disassembler_for_x64_riscv64/)
  > The only noticeable difference is probably how API is done: Iced has kind of Intel-syntax API where you use correct registers to determine reigster size e.g EAX is 32-bit and RAX is 64-bit register and asmkit has `mov64`,`mov32` etc and also has a postfix of `rr` for register-register operation, `rm` for register-memory and so on. In Iced you would write `asm.mov(RAX, RDI)` and in asmkit: `asm.mov64rr(RAX, RDI)`.
