# Memory Alignment
> Words, doublewords, and quadwords do not need to be aligned in memory on natural boundaries. The natural boundaries for words, doublewords, and quadwords are even-numbered addresses, addresses evenly divisible by four, and addresses evenly divisible by eight, respectively. However, to improve the performance of programs, data structures (especially stacks) should be aligned on natural boundaries whenever possible. The reason for this is that the processor requires two memory accesses to make an unaligned memory access; aligned accesses require only one memory access. A word or doubleword operand that crosses a 4-byte boundary or a quadword operand that crosses an 8-byte boundary is considered unaligned and requires two separate memory bus cycles for access.

> Some instructions that operate on double quadwords require memory operands to be aligned on a natural boundary. These instructions generate a general-protection exception (#GP) if an unaligned operand is specified. A natural boundary for a double quadword is any address evenly divisible by 16. Other instructions that operate on double quadwords permit unaligned access (without generating a general-protection exception). However, additional memory bus cycles are required to access unaligned data from memory.[^sdm]

> For general x86 load/store instructions, the penalty is speed, as more cycles are required to do the read or write. unalignment may also affect caching, leading to cache line splitting, and cache boundary straddling. It also prevents atomicity on reads and writes (which are guaranteed for all aligned read/writes of x86, barriers and propagation is something else, but using LOCK'ed instruction on unaligned data may cause and exception or greatly increase the already massive penalty the bu lock incurs), which is a no-no for concurrent programming.[^so]
